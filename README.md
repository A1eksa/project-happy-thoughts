# Happy Thoughts

This weeks project was creating Happy Thought app. Focus was on useEffect hook , mount, unmounta and change state. 
Happy thoughts were send via api so we practiced how to receive but also how to send data. 

## The problem

There were no bigger issues this week, instead i managed to do additional learning.
